        Add a WeightedEvaluator that accepts multiple criteria with weights:
        
        result = await evaluate(
            output=text,
            criteria={
                "accuracy": (0.5, "Must be factually correct"),
                "clarity": (0.3, "Must be easy to understand"),
                "brevity": (0.2, "Must be concise")
            },
            evaluators=["weighted_criteria"]
        )
